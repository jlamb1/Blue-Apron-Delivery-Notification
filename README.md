# Blue Apron Delivery Notification

This tool pings Blue Apron's delivery partner's API to see the status of your shipment. Once the shipment is marked as delivered, you'll receive an iMessage notification.

## Install Steps

 - git clone
 - npm install
 - open the .env.example file in your code editor, and change the values to your info.
 - rename .env.example to .env
 - In your terminal, type "npm start"

### Will this work on non-Apple devices?

No. iMessage is free, while SMS costs money to send. Pull requests are welcome
